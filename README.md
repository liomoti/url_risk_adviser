# URL Risk Adviser
Made by Moti Shaul
<br><br>
The URL Risk Adviser script leverages data from <b>VirusTotal</b> API to <b>analyze the safety of URLs</b>. <br>
By querying VirusTotal's API, the script gives users valuable insights into the <b>potential risks</b> associated with a given URL. <br>
The script assists users in <b>proactively protecting</b> themselves against <b>malware, phishing attacks, and other online threats</b>. <br> <br>
Once the user sets the API Key and provides the URL, the script fetches data about the URL. <br>
It then analyzes this data to generate a <b>comprehensive report</b> with relevant information, including a <b>clear conclusion</b> called the 'Risk Level'. <br>
Additionally, the script allows the user to <b>output the report to a text file</b> alongside the output to the console window.
